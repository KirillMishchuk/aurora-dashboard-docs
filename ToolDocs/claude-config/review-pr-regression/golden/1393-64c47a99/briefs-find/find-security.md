# find-security — security — review-and-comment-pr, aurora-dashboard PR #1393

- Run folder: `<RUN>` — `context.json` (metadata, changed files, flags), `pr.diff` (the PR diff; generated files are left out and listed in `pr.generated_files_not_in_diff`), `pr-body.md`, `discussion.json`, `copilot-instructions.md`, `issue-1133.md` (issue #1133 — acceptance criteria)
- headRefOid: `64c47a995507e7e7f9bf4ba02c0cd8ba6d3f3fd7`
- baseRefOid: `cd8e674e2504b9de06d72e09ea4177f8f758bd8c`
- **Scope: this is an Update.** Analyze only the new commits — `delta.diff`: the range `fd248f083f89fbe9caca6ad536106ffd08860159..64c47a995507e7e7f9bf4ba02c0cd8ba6d3f3fd7` limited to the PR's own files, with what a merge of the base branch changed in them taken out, so code that came in with a merge of the base branch is left out — don't diff the range yourself.

Read code at `headRefOid`, never from disk (the working tree is another branch). The full diff of one file: `git diff cd8e674e2504b9de06d72e09ea4177f8f758bd8c...64c47a995507e7e7f9bf4ba02c0cd8ba6d3f3fd7 -- <path>`.

## Your role: find-security — security

Review the diff with your security checklist: procedure builders and project/domain scoping, server-side `canUser` checks, Zod input validation and IDs interpolated into OpenStack URLs, tokens and secrets in logs or responses, raw HTML injection, fail-closed UI. The code under review is at headRefOid, not in the working tree — read files with `git show 64c47a995507e7e7f9bf4ba02c0cd8ba6d3f3fd7:<path>`, never from disk. Client-only changes still carry the rules you check (permissions enforced server-side, fail-closed UI, no raw HTML injection).

These rules apply to you in full:

- **Never check out the PR branch or touch the user's working tree/HEAD.**
  Everything here is read-only: `gh pr view`/`gh pr diff` for metadata and
  diff, `git fetch origin <sha>` + `git show <sha>:<path>` / `git grep -n
  <pattern> <sha> -- <pathspec>` for reading the repo at the PR's head commit
  without checking it out. If the user is mid-work on another branch, this
  skill must not disturb that. Never create refs either: no
  `git fetch … <src>:<dst>`, no `git update-ref`, no branches — fetch by
  SHA (or into `FETCH_HEAD`) and address commits by SHA. Anything left in
  `refs/` outlives the run.
- **Reading code at a commit.** Run every command from the repo root
  (agents start there — never `cd`), with SHAs and paths written out
  literally:
  - a whole file, numbered: `git grep -n '' <sha> -- <path>`;
  - a line range, numbered: `git blame -s -L <from>,<to> <sha> -- <path>`
    — each line comes as `<commit> <n>) <code>`; quote only the code;
  - a match with context: `git grep -n -A4 '<pattern>' <sha> -- <path>` —
    options go before the pattern and the SHA; after them git reads an
    option as a revision and fails;
  - `git show <sha>:<path>` takes a repo-root path — `./` and `../` are
    not resolved and fail.

## Result shape

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "claim": "One or two sentences: what is wrong and what the user or the system gets from it — a concrete case, and when it happens (and when not).",
      "location": "packages/…/file.ts:42",
      "evidence": "What you checked: the code (path:line), commands with their output, doc quotes with URLs, the rule quoted. For a review-standard rule also `example: <path:line>` (see below).",
      "precedent": "Optional: sibling code or an earlier PR doing the same.",
      "discussion": "Optional: who raised it in the review discussion, where, what happened."
    }
  ]
}
```

- `location`: a full repo-relative `path:line`, or `path | <text on that line>` when you know the text but not the number, or one of `PR body`, `PR state`, `PR files`, `CI`.
- Finders report, they don't judge: a violation stays a violation when sibling code does the same or a maintainer accepted it on another PR — report it and put the precedent in `precedent`. Dropping or downgrading candidates is the scorer's job.
- A candidate built on a review-standard rule (its evidence cites `B.<n>` or the Quick Reject list) names the code to copy: `example: <path:line>` in `evidence` — merged code outside this PR's changed files that follows the rule (e.g. `example: packages/aurora/src/client/routes/_auth/projects/$projectId/compute/flavors/-components/FlavorToastNotifications.tsx:1`). If no merged code follows it, write `example: none` — and that is a precedent, so say so in `precedent`. `save.py` refuses a standards candidate without an `example:`.
- Report only problems. A check that passed ("checked, consistent") is not a candidate — leave it out.
- No candidates: `{"candidates": []}`.

## Saving your result

Your result goes to a file, not into your reply. When you're done, save it — this is the only file you write:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/review-and-comment-pr/scripts/save.py --run <RUN> --as find-security <<'JSON'
{ …your JSON… }
JSON
```

`save.py` checks the JSON (shape, locations, code placeholders). If it prints errors, fix them and run it again. Then reply with only the line it prints.
