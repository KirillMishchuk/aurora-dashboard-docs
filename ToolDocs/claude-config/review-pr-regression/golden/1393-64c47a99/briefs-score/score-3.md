# Scorer 3 — review-and-comment-pr, aurora-dashboard PR #1393

- Run folder: `<RUN>` — `context.json` (metadata, changed files, flags), `pr.diff` (the PR diff; generated files are left out and listed in `pr.generated_files_not_in_diff`), `pr-body.md`, `discussion.json`, `copilot-instructions.md`, `issue-1133.md` (issue #1133 — acceptance criteria)
- headRefOid: `64c47a995507e7e7f9bf4ba02c0cd8ba6d3f3fd7`
- baseRefOid: `cd8e674e2504b9de06d72e09ea4177f8f758bd8c`
- **Scope: this is an Update.** Analyze only the new commits — `delta.diff`: the range `fd248f083f89fbe9caca6ad536106ffd08860159..64c47a995507e7e7f9bf4ba02c0cd8ba6d3f3fd7` limited to the PR's own files, with what a merge of the base branch changed in them taken out, so code that came in with a merge of the base branch is left out — don't diff the range yourself.

Read code at `headRefOid`, never from disk (the working tree is another branch). The full diff of one file: `git diff cd8e674e2504b9de06d72e09ea4177f8f758bd8c...64c47a995507e7e7f9bf4ba02c0cd8ba6d3f3fd7 -- <path>`.

## Your role: scorer 3 of 3

The candidates below were found by other agents; you didn't find them and must not take their word for them. Read the scoring rules first — `.claude/skills/review-and-comment-pr/references/scoring.md` — all of it, and follow it. Then, for each candidate, open the cited code at headRefOid, re-run any command the evidence rests on, and score it.

Two rules scorers have broken before — apply them as written:

- **Precedent-table rule.** If a candidate matches a row of "Severity precedents" and the code does what the row describes, it is verified: score it at least 50 with the row's severity. "I can't tell whether it is hit in practice" is already priced into that severity — not a reason for 25.
- **Evidence rule.** When a candidate quotes an official API reference or the review standards and the code does what the quote says it must not, it is verified — score it on its impact (50, 75 or 100). "Can't run it" or "can't reach the docs" is never a reason for 25.

## Same place

These candidates point at the same place. For each, set `same_as` (see the result shape): the same problem, or a different one.

- C15, C17

## Earlier findings of this report

This is an Update: the report it extends already raised the findings below. A candidate that objects to the PR doing what one of them asked (it moved a column, renamed a string, restructured code as an earlier finding requested) is not a new problem: score it 0 and name the earlier finding in the reason. If the change was made badly — it breaks something or does only half of it — score that as usual.

## Candidates

The evidence is as the finders reported it, unchanged.

### C15 — from describer (acceptance)
- **Claim:** Acceptance criterion partly met: Comprehensive error handling provides user-friendly feedback for Barbican errors.
- **Location:** PR files
- **Evidence:**

`keyManagerRouter.ts` maps errors through `mapKmError` (`:52`), which still drops the Barbican error body, so users see generic messages.

### C17 — from describer (acceptance)
- **Claim:** Acceptance criterion unmet: Complete testing coverage (unit, integration, E2E) is achieved.
- **Location:** PR files
- **Evidence:**

Unit tests exist for the router, schemas and list/row components (for example `keyManagerRouter.test.ts`). No tests were added for modals, detail views, navigation or the layout guard, and there are no E2E tests.

## Result shape

```json
{
  "scores": [
    {
      "id": "C1",
      "score": 75,
      "severity": "Moderate",
      "category": "Performance",
      "location": "path:line, verified at headRefOid",
      "reason": "One or two sentences: what you checked and found (file:line, quote, behaviour) and why this score and severity. Written for the PR's readers — it can be posted: \"the head commit\", \"the PR description\", not run-folder file names.",
      "same_as": null,
      "precedent": null
    }
  ]
}
```

- One entry per candidate, every candidate exactly once.
- `score`: 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100. For 50 and up, `severity` (Critical, Major, Moderate, Low, Trivial), `category` (Bug, Security, Accessibility, UI/UX, Code Quality, Performance, Docs, Test coverage) and a `location` that exists at headRefOid (`path:line`, `path | text on that line`, or `PR body` / `PR state` / `PR files` / `CI`). Below 50, leave them out.
- `precedent`: required for 50 and up — the reader's tag, it never changes the score. `{"kind": "existing", "ref": "path:line"}` when merged code already has the same problem — `ref` is a line that itself breaks the same rule. Sibling code that does it right (e.g. a list that already debounces) is not a precedent: it's evidence for the finding, put it in `reason`. Find that line at baseRefOid (`git grep -n '<pattern>' <baseRefOid> -- <pathspec>`). `{"kind": "deferred", "ref": "<URL>"}` when a maintainer accepted or postponed the same point, on another PR or in `discussion.json`: open the thread, `ref` is the comment's GitHub URL. Both apply → `deferred`. Neither, or you couldn't confirm the candidate's `precedent` → `null`.
- `same_as`: required for a candidate in a group above — the id of the candidate in the same group that describes the same problem (score that one; this one is then dropped — `score` and `reason` may be left out for it), or `null` if it is a different problem. Elsewhere leave it out.

## Saving your result

Your result goes to a file, not into your reply. When you're done, save it — this is the only file you write:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/review-and-comment-pr/scripts/save.py --run <RUN> --as score-3 <<'JSON'
{ …your JSON… }
JSON
```

`save.py` checks the JSON (shape, locations, code placeholders). If it prints errors, fix them and run it again. Then reply with only the line it prints.
